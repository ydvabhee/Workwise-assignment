# Project Overview

This is a full-stack application that consists of two main parts:

1. **Client**: A frontend application built using **Next.js**, located in the `/client` directory.
2. **Server**: A backend application built using **Node.js** and **Express**, located in the `/server` directory.

Both apps work together to deliver a seamless user experience. The **client** handles the frontend, user interface, and interactions, while the **server** manages data, authentication, and APIs.

## Project Structure

```
/client  - Next.js frontend application
/server  - Node.js Express backend application
```

### **Client (Next.js)**

- A modern, server-rendered React application that handles the user interface.
- It includes user authentication and separate functionalities for buyers and sellers.

For more details on how to set up and run the **client** app, see the [client README](https://github.com/ydvabhee/Workwise-assignment/tree/master/client).

### **Server (Express & Node.js)**

- A RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.
- Features include user authentication, authorization, and data management with a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize.

For more details on how to set up and run the **server** app, see the [server README](https://github.com/ydvabhee/Workwise-assignment/tree/master/server).
